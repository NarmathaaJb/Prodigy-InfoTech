# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

This project involves the use of K-means clustering to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column               | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| CustomerID           | An identifier for each customer.                                             |
| Gender               | Indicates the gender of the customer (Male or Female).                       |
| Age                  | Represents the age of the customer in years.                                 |
| Annual Income (k$)   | Denotes the annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.           |
| Spending Score (1–100)| A score ranging from 1 to 100 that quantifies the customer’s spending habits and preferences. A higher score indicates a higher tendency to spend. |
